# GreenSwap

## ♻️ Empowering Individuals. Decentralizing Recycling.

GreenSwap enables **consumers to sell recyclables directly to businesses**, transforming waste into a **tradeable, liquid asset** while driving a **circular economy** with transparency and fairness.

Just as Bitcoin unlocked idle money, **GreenSwap unlocks idle waste.**

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

🌍 **Environmental Impact:** Reduce landfill waste by connecting recyclers directly to buyers.
💸 **Economic Inclusion:** Let individuals profit directly from their recyclables.
🔗 **Transparency:** Leveraging blockchain to track recycling contributions, payouts, and supply chains.

GreenSwap decentralizes control and creates a transparent, incentivized recycling economy accessible to anyone.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ **Snap & List:** Consumers take a photo of their recyclables. (AI categorization planned for automated sorting and pricing suggestions.)
2️⃣ **Match:** Businesses are matched automatically to available recyclables or can browse listings.
3️⃣ **Payment:** Transactions currently in **EGP within Egypt**+
4️⃣ **Pickup/Drop-off:** Handled by our **Green Captains (or Eco Captains)** system, a ride-share-like network for seamless pickup and drop-off of recyclables.
